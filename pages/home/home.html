        <p class="section__home--para">I just bought a new car. Trust me, it was NOT 62% OFF. Nope. It was like 12+% UP. As a Last Bottle super-savvy wunderkind of wine shopping who’s on the secret mailing list, you get to see wines at 62% OFF retail at times. Maybe even Reserve Cabernet from the rockin’, glorious 2018 Napa vintage. Like today, where we might just put a jagged crack in the Internet in the next 34 minutes, or however long it lasts. I’m getting 6 to make up for the car markup. </p>

        <p class="section__home--para">BOOM! Edict’s new ‘18 just landed in the Napa Valley Nerve Center, 100% Cabernet, 110% unabashedly lavish and seductive, oh YES. We’ve done a few of their pinots over the years, and we’re picky as heck, as you know, and this one definitely made the cut and we pulled the trigger on as much as we could get (hint: not enough). </p>

        <p class="section__home--para">Put on Weezer’s cover of Metallica’s “Enter Sandman” here in Napa 3 days ago (!) -- it’s pretty rocking but not thrashy, mosh-pit level Cab, if you get our drift. No stage-diving, but definitely gets the blood pumping with wild, brambly, juicy blackberry, creamy, perfectly-ripe raspberry and chai tea spice, cigar box and allspice. Velvety, creamy but manly, too. THE PRICE! Goodness gracious, y’all!! While it lasts!</p>
